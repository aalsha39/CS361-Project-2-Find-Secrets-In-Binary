0. Just run ./0 in your project 2 directory.
1. This time I ran "./1" to see what the program wanted. I find out it wants a number that       *it generates so I used "ltrace ./1". Which gave me the srand and rand. Trace the rand       *to what it equals to. You will see a hex number convert that to decimal and then type       *it in. That will give you the secret phase.
2. Run "./2" to see what the program wants. The program says not to use gdb. So use "ltrace"     *"./2" and if curl_easy_perform equals to 0 then the password is "yes" without quotes.       *If curl_easy_perform is anything else then the password is "no" no quotation marks.
3. Run "./3". It says it checking for the existence of a special file with a special name.       *So we "ltrace ./3" to learn what the file is called. The file name is "iamspecial". So      *create a file called "iamspecial" no quotations. We also have to change the permission      *of the two files. To do this we "chmod +rwxr 3" and "chmod +rwxr iamspecial". Don't use     *the quotations. Then run "./3" and there is the secret.
4. Run "./4". It'll say you cant run it because your missing a shared library "lib361.so". Go    *ahead and make that file in the same directory. Then use this command "sentenv"             *"LD_LIBRARY_PATH ." make sure to include the ".". Then create another file called           *"uselib.c". In the file create it as you normally would a c file with a main and            *include statements. Then create a function in the c file called "secretoperation" with      *a return type of int. The parameters should be "int x, int y, int result". In the           *function you should have "result = x+y; return result;". Thats it save and exit that c      *file. Next you have to compile the file into an independant object file using "gcc -c"      *"-Wall -Werror -fpic uselib.c". Next you want to link your library with your new object     *file. With this "gcc -shared -o lib361.so uselib.o". Lastly run "./4" and you should        *have your secret.
